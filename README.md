# ToDo App

Project ToDo app, build for the purpose of learning basic concepts of React.js. 
It only consist of minimal functionalities such as add, toggle, remove and edit tasks
and I'm storing data in the local storage of browser which will help in not losing the
data on refresh. This project also helped me in learning Tailwind CSS for styling purpose.
